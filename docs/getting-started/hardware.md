# Getting the hardware

> [!NOTE]
> This section is still work in progress. Not everything will be accurate or complete.

### Ordering it yourself

The PCB design is created using the free and open source software KiCAD. You can find installation instructions and more
information about it [here](https://www.kicad.org/).

For your convenience, the PCB design files are available in the hardware repository. You can find
it [here](https://github.com/deppenpfostierung/bicycle-led-hardware/tree/main/bicycle-led-main/jlcpcb/production_files).
However, we do not guarantee that the files work, are up to date or can be produced.

For ordering with JLCPCB, we recommend using this <a href="https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools" target="_blank">plugin for KiCAD</a>.

### WIP

### After receiving the hardware

When you received the hardware, you can start [flashing the firmware](software.md).
